  \textit{Finishings, for me, can be the hardest part.
          Not because there's any great skill involved in these final
          steps---putting on a few buttons, closing up a few edges---but
          because if you've done your job all the true craftsmanship has
          already occurred. The finishings are mere inevitabilities.
          It's at the finishings that you must come to terms with the
          idea that perfection is a necessary goal---precisely because it
          is unattainable. If you don't aim for perfection you cannot make
          anything great. And yet true perfection is impossible.
          So at the finish you must reconcile yourself to failure.
          It's not perfect. You have to make your peace with that.
          How? Well---you sit at your board, you lay out your tools,
          and you start again.}
