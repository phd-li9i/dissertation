  \caption{\small Scan-matching as ``laser odometry": the robot moves from the
           lower left portion of the environment to the upper right, capturing
           2D range scans along its trajectory. The coloured routes show the
           estimated path of the robot derived from each method. The proposed
           method's error is invariant to angular and locational displacement}
