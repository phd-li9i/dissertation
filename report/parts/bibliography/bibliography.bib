abstract = {This article proposes a semantic grid mapping method for domestic robot navigation. Occupancy grid maps are sufficient for mobile robots to complete point-to-point navigation tasks in 2-D small-scale environments. However, when used in the real domestic scene, grid maps are lack of semantic information for end users to specify navigation tasks conveniently. Semantic grid maps, enhancing the occupancy grid map with the semantics of objects and rooms, endowing the robots with the capacity of robust navigation skills and human-friendly operation modes, are thus proposed to overcome this limitation. In our method, an object semantic grid map is built with low-cost sonar and binocular stereovision sensors by correctly fusing the occupancy grid map and object point clouds. Topological spaces of each object are defined to make robots autonomously select navigation destinations. Based on the domestic common sense of the relationship between rooms and objects, topological segmentation is used to get room semantics. Our method is evaluated in a real homelike environment, and the results show that the generated map is at a satisfactory precision and feasible for a domestic mobile robot to complete navigation tasks commanded in natural language with a high success rate.},

The ability to anticipate the next movements of pedestrians on the street is a key task in many areas, e.g., self-driving auto vehicles, mobile robots or advanced surveillance systems, and they still represent a technological challenge. The performance of state-of-the-art pedestrian trajectory prediction methods currently benefits from the advancements in sensors and associated signal processing technologies. The current paper reviews the most recent deep learning-based solutions for the problem of pedestrian trajectory prediction along with employed sensors and afferent processing methodologies, and it performs an overview of the available datasets, performance metrics used in the evaluation process, and practical applications. Finally, the current work exposes the research gaps from the literature and outlines potential new research directions.},

The prime utilization of such robots is to minimize person-to-person contact and to ensure cleaning, sterilization and support in hospitals and similar facilities such as quarantine. This will result in minimizing the life threat to medical staff and doctors taking an active role in the management of theCOVID-19 pandemic. The intention of the present research is to highlight the importance of medical robotics in general and then to connect its utilization with the perspective of COVID-19 management so that the hospital management can direct themselves to maximize the use of medical robots for various medical procedures. This is despite the popularity of telemedicine, which is also effective in similar situations. In essence, the recent achievement of the Korean and Chinese health sectors in obtaining active control of the COVID-19 pandemic was not possible without the use of state of the art medical technology.},

@article{Gustafsson2002,
abstract = {A framework for positioning, navigation, and tracking problems using particle filters (sequential Monte Carlo methods) is developed. It consists of a class of motion models and a general nonlinear measurement equation in position. A general algorithm is presented, which is parsimonious with the particle dimension. It is based on marginalization, enabling a Kalman filter to estimate all position derivatives, and the particle filter becomes low dimensional. This is of utmost importance for high-performance real-time applications. Automotive and airborne applications illustrate numerically the advantage over classical Kalman filter-based algorithms. Here, the use of nonlinear models and non-Gaussian noise is the main explanation for the improvement in accuracy. More specifically, we describe how the technique of map matching is used to match an aircraft's elevation profile to a digital elevation map and a car's horizontal driven path to a street map. In both cases, real-time implementations are available, and tests have shown that the accuracy in both cases is comparable with satellite navigation (as GPS) but with higher integrity. Based on simulations, we also argue how the particle filter can be used for positioning based on cellular phone measurements, for integrated navigation in aircraft, and for target tracking in aircraft and cars. Finally, the particle filter enables a promising solution to the combined task of navigation and tracking, with possible application to airborne hunting and collision avoidance systems in cars.},

abstract = {In recent years, particle filters have solved several hard perceptual problems in robotics. Early successes of particle filters were limited to low-dimensional estimation problems, such as the problem of robot localization in environments with known maps. More recently, researchers have begun exploiting structural properties of robotic domains that have led to successful particle filter applications in spaces with as many as 100,000 dimensions. The fact that every model--no mater how detailed--fails to capture the full complexity of even the most simple robotic environments has lead to specific tricks and techniques essential for the success of particle filters in robotic domains. This article surveys some of these recent innovations, and provides pointers to in-depth articles on the use of particle filters in robotics.},

Navigating hundreds of meters without any human intervention requires the robot to be able to build various representations of its environment, to plan and execute trajectories according to the kind of terrain traversed, to control its motions and to localize itself as it moves. All these activities have to be scheduled, triggered, controlled and interrupted according to the rover context. In this paper, we briefly review some functionalities that have been developed in our laboratory, and implemented on board the Marsokhod model robot, Lama. We then present how the various concurrent instances of the perception, localization and motion generation functionalities are integrated. Experimental results illustrate the functionalities throughout the paper.},
