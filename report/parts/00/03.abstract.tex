\noindent
In this work, a robust decentralized model predictive control regime for a team
of cooperating robot systems is designed. Their assumed dynamics are
in continuous time and non-linear. The problem involves agents whose dynamics
are independent of one-another, and its solution couples their constraints as a
means of capturing the cooperative behaviour required.
Analytical proofs are given to show that, under the proposed control regime:
(a) Subject to initial feasibility, the optimization solved at each step
by each agent will always be feasible, irrespective of whether or not
disturbances affect the agents. In the former case, recursive feasibility is
established through successive restriction of each agent's constraints during
the periodic solution to its respective optimization problem.
(b) Each (sub)system can be stabilized to a desired configuration, either
asymptotically when uncertainty is absent, or within a neighbourhood of it, when
uncertainty is present, thus attenuating the affecting disturbance.
In this context, disturbances are assumed to be additive and bounded.
Simulations verify the efficacy of the proposed method over a range of different
operating environments.
